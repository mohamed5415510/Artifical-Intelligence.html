<h2><u>Advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence</u></h2>
 
Different voices in the technology sector defend the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Infinia MLâ€™s Product Manager, Andy Chan, at a TED Talks with over 40,000 visits on Youtube, breaks down the various benefits of AI at work.

Kai-Fu Lee, founder of the venture capital fund Sinovation Ventures and a leading figure in the field of technology, also describes the main benefits of AI in a TED Talks video with over 600,000 plays.

Taking into account these two experts, these would be the main advantages of AI applied to a business sector
<p>
    the risk in ai Some voices believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has risks. Especially if the potential of AI is explored and not just limited to reproducing human tasks. Authors such as Stephen Hawking or Bill Gates and different researchers have expressed their concern about AI.

    With regard to barriers to entry, these would be some of the most common that can occur in the business environment:

                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li> Automates the processes.Artificial Intelligence allows robots to develop repetitive, routine and process optimization tasks automatically and without human intervention.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li> Enhance creative tasks. AI frees people from routine and repetitive tasks and allows them to spend more time on creative functions.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Provides precision.The application of AI is capable of providing greater precision than humans, for example in industrial environments, machines can make decisions that were previously made manually or monitored without AI.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Reduces human error. AI reduces failures caused by human limitations. In some production lines, AI is used to detect, by means of infrared sensors, small cracks or defects in parts that are undetectable by the human eye.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Reduces time spent on data analysis. It allows the analysis and exploitation of the data derived from production to be carried out in real time.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Predictive maintenance. It allows to carry out a maintenance of the industrial equipment based on the times and conditions of operation of the same, allowing to increase its performance and life cycle.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Improvement in decision making at both production and business levels. By having more information in a structured way, it allows each of the people in charge to make decisions in a faster and more efficient way.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Control and optimization of productive processes and production lines Through AI, more efficient, error-free processes are achieved, obtaining greater control over production lines in the company.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Increase in productivity and quality in production. AI not only increases productivity at the machine level, it also makes workers more productive and increases the quality of the work they do. Having more information allows them to have a more focused view of their work and make better decisions.</li>

                    Data availability. Often,data is presented in isolation across companies or is inconsistent and of low quality, presenting a significant challenge for companies seeking to create value from AI at scale. In order to overcome this barrier, it will be vital to draw up a clear strategy from the outset so thatAI data can be extracted in an organized and consistent manner.
                </li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Lack of qualified professionals. Another obstacle that often occurs at the business level for the adoption of AI is the scarcity of profiles with skills and experience in this type of implementations. It is crucial in these cases to have professionals who have already worked on projects of the same magnitude.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>The cost and implementation time of AI projects. The cost of implementation, both at the time and the economic level, is a very important factor in choosing to execute this type of project. Companies that lack internal skills or are not familiar with AI systems, must value the outsourcing of both implementation and maintenance in order to obtain successful results in their project.</li>

    <p><h3>In short, AI has become a very important resource for companies as it allows them to be much more competitive and obtain greater benefits, especially in manufacturing and production environments.

        It is for all these reasons that these types of professional profiles are increasingly in demand in the industrial sector, making it essential to have groups of experts in the field to develop efficient strategies for digital transformation.</h3> </p>
