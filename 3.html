It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence and one of the most common that is responsible for developing techniques for the algorithms that have been developed to learn and improve over time. It involves a large amount of code and complex mathematical formulas to enable machines to find the solution to a given problem.

This aspect of AI is one of the most developed for commercial or business purposes at present, as it is used to process large amounts of data quickly and deposit them in a manner that is understandable to humans.

A clear example of this is data from production plants where the connected elements feed a constant flow of data on machine status, production, functionality, temperature, etc. to a central core.

This enormous amount of data derived from the production process must be analyzed in order to achieve continuous improvement and appropriate decision making, however the volume of this data means that humans must spend a great deal of time (days) on analysis and traceability.

This is when Machine Learning comes into play, allowing data to be analyzed as it is incorporated into the production process and identifying patterns or anomalies in operation more quickly and accurately. In this way, warnings or alerts can be triggered for decision making. 

However, the ML is a relatively broad category. The development of these artificial intelligence nodes has given rise to what is now known as Deep Learning (DL). 
  <p>  
  <h2> deep learning </h2> 
    
    It is an even more specific version of Machine Learning (ML) that refers to a set of algorithms (or neural networks) that are designed for machine learning and participate in non-linear reasoning.

    In this technique the algorithms are grouped into artificial neural networks that are intended to act like the human neural networks present in the brain. It is a technique that allows you to learn in a deep way without a specific code for it.
    
    Deep Learning is fundamental to perform much more advanced functions allowing the analysis of a wide range of factors at the same time.
    
    For example, Deep Learing is used to contextualize the information received by the sensors used in autonomous cars: the distance of objects, the speed at which they move, predictions based on the movement they are making, etc. They use this information to decide how and when to change lanes, among other things.
    
    We are still at a stage where the DL is still in a very early stage of development of its full potential. We see that it is increasingly used in business by converting data into much more detailed and scalable sets.

<h2>Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
Artificial Intelligence can be divided in various types, there are mainly two types of main categorization which are based on capabilities and based on functionally of AI. Following is flow diagram which explain the types of AI.

<h2>AI type-1: Based on Capabilities</h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><h3><u>General AI</u></h3>
        <oi type="1">
            <li>General AI is a type of intelligence which could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like a human.</li>
            <li>The idea behind the general AI to make such a system which could be smarter and think like a human by its own.</li>
            <li>Currently, there is no such system exist which could come under general AI and can perform any task as perfect as a human.</li>
            <li>The worldwide researchers are now focused on developing machines with General AI</li>
            <li>As systems with general AI are still under research, and it will take lots of efforts and time to develop such systems. </li>
        </oi>        
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><h3><u>Weak AI or Narrow AI</u></h3>
        <oi type="1">
            <li>Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence.The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the world of Artificial Intelligence.</li>
            <li>Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for one specific task. Hence it is also termed as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.</li>
            <li>Apple Siriis a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited pre-defined range of functions.</li>
            <li>IBM's Watson supercomputer also comes under Narrow AI, as it uses an Expert system approach combined with Machine learning and natural language processing.</li>
            <li>Some Examples of Narrow AI are playing chess, purchasing suggestions on e-commerce site, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image recognition.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><h3><u>super AI</u></h3>
        <oi type="1">
            <li>Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than human with cognitive properties. It is an outcome of general AI</li>
            <li>Some key characteristics of strong AI include capability include the ability to think, to reason,solve the puzzle, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate by its own.</li>
            <li>Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence. Development of such systems in real is still world changing task.</li>
        </oi>

<h2>Artificial Intelligence type-2: Based on functionality</h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><h3><u>Reactive Machines</u></h3>
        <oi type="1">
            <li>Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.</li>
            <li>These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best action.</li>
            <li>Google's AlphaGo is also an example of reactive machines.</li>
        </oi>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><h3><u>limited memory</u></h3>
        <oi type="1">
            <li>Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.</li>
            <li>Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems. These cars can store recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of other cars, speed limit, and other information to navigate the road.</li>
        </oi>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><h3><u>Theory of Mind</u></h3>
        <oi type="1">
            <li>Theory of Mind AI should understand the human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans.</li>
            <li>This type of AI machines are still not developed, but researchers are making lots of efforts and improvement for developing such AI machines. </li>
        </oi>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><h3><u>Self-Awareness</u></h3>
        <oi type="1">
            <li>Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent, and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and self-awareness.</li>
            <li>These machines will be smarter than human mind</li>
            <li>Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept</li>
